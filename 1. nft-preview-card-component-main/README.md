## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
section:nth-of-type(1) {
  background-color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
  height: 294px;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.equil-img:active {
  cursor: pointer;
  opacity: 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I want to be able to complete projects in a shorter period of time. Also, I would like to practice more my Flexbox knowledge and responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- [About hsl()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl()) - This MDN article helped me to better understand the hsl colors.
