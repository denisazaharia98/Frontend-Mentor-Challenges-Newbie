## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```js
const emailRegex =
  /^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&â€™*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/;

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
...
  if (emailRegex.test(email.value) == true) {
    paragraph = "Thanks for being awesome!";
    ...
  } else {
    paragraph = "Please provide a valid email adress";
    ...
  }
  answer.append(paragraph);
});
```

### Continued development

I want to keep doing projects.
